Fizzy aims to be a fast, deterministic, and pedantic WebAssembly interpreter written in C++.

## Goals

I) Code quality
- [x] Clean and modern C++17 codebase without external dependencies
- [ ] Easily embeddable (*and take part of the standardisation of the "C/C++ embedding API"*)

II) Simplicity
- [x] Only implement WebAssembly 1.0 (and none of the proposals)
- [x] Interpreter only
- [x] Support only WebAssembly binary encoding as an input (no support for the text format (`.wat`/`.wast`))

III) Conformance
- [x] Should have 99+% unit test coverage
- [x] Should pass the official WebAssembly test suite
- [x] Should have stricter tests than the official test suite

IV) First class support for determistic applications (*blockchain*)
- [ ] Support canonical handling of floating point (i.e. NaNs stricter than in the spec)
- [ ] Support an efficient big integer API (256-bit and perhaps 384-bit)
- [ ] Support optional runtime metering in the interpreter
- [ ] Support enforcing a call depth bound
- [ ] Further restrictions of complexity (e.g. number of locals, number of function parameters, number of labels, etc.)

## Building and using

Fizzy uses CMake as a build system:
```sh
$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake ..
$ cmake --build .
```

This will build Fizzy as a library and since there is no public API
(the so called *embedder API* in WebAssembly) yet, this is not very useful.

Building with the `FIZZY_TESTING` option will output a few useful utilities:

```sh
$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake -DFIZZY_TESTING=ON ..
$ cmake --build .
```

These utilities are as follows:

### fizzy-bench

This can be used to run benchmarks available in the `test/benchmarks` directory.
Read [this guide](./test/benchmarks/README.md) for a short introduction.

### fizzy-spectests

Fizzy is capable of executing the official WebAssembly tests.
Follow [this guide](./test/spectests/README.md) for using the tool.

### fizzy-unittests

This is the unit tests suite of Fizzy.

## Special notes about floating point

### Exceptions

Certain floating point operations can emit *exceptions* as defined by the IEEE 754 standard.
(Here is a [summary from the GNU C Library](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/FP-Exceptions.html)).
It is however up to the language how these manifest, and in C/C++ depending on the settings they can result in
a) setting of a flag; b) or in *traps*, such as the `SIGFPE` signal.

Fizzy does not manipulate this setting, but expects it to be left at option a) of above, which is the default.
In the GNU C Library this can be controlled via the [`feenableexcept` and `fedisableexcept` functions](https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/libc/manual/html_node/Control-Functions.html).

The user of the Fizzy library has to ensure this is not set to *trap* mode.
The behavior with traps enabled is unpredictable and correct behaviour is not guaranteed, thus we strongly advise against using them.

### Rounding

The IEEE 754 standard defines four rounding directions (or modes):
- to nearest, tie to even (default),
- toward -∞ (rounding down),
- toward +∞ (rounding up),
- toward  0 (truncation).

The WebAssembly specification expects the default, "to nearest", rounding mode for instructions
whose result can be influenced by rounding.

Fizzy does not manipulate this setting, and expects the same rounding mode as WebAssembly,
otherwise the result of some instructions may be different.
In the GNU C Library the rounding mode can be controlled via the [`fesetround` and `fegetround` functions](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Rounding.html).

If strict compliance is sought with WebAssembly, then the user of Fizzy must ensure to keep the default rounding mode.


## Development

### Performance testing

We use the following build configuration for performance testing:

- Release build type (`-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release` which enables `-O3` and disables asserts)

- Latest version of GCC compiler (so far produces faster binaries than Clang)

- libstdc++ standard library

- Link-Time Optimization (`-DCMAKE_INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION=TRUE`)

  This does not give big performance gains (v0.3: +1%, v0.4: -3%), but most importantly
  eliminates performance instabilities related to layout changes in the code section of the binaries.
  See [#510](https://github.com/wasmx/fizzy/pull/510) for example.

- No "native" architecture selection (`-march=native`)
